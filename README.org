This script stitches together =tesseract= and =translate-shell= to quickly
pop-up language translations.

This script has two main use-cases:

- OCR mode :: This mode prompts you to draw a rectangle around on-screen text
  which you want to translate. This mode is useful for translating subtitles in
  videos or games, or in images.
- Selection mode :: This mode will translate the region of text you currently
  have selected.

The primary motivation of this script is to show translations /quickly/. When
starting to learn a new language, I find that I need to translate words and
phrases constantlyâ€”often multiple times per sentence. This makes it important to
be able to bring up a translation in only one or two clicks.

  stdout  Write tranlated text to STDOUT.

OCR Cleaning:

  To improve the chance of a good translation, when scanning the screen with
  OCR, this script will attempt to clean up the image before passing it to
  Tesseract:

  - Tesseract requires black text on a white background. If the image is mostly
    dark (and probably white text on a black background), the image colors are
    negated.
  - An attempt is made to remove any background or noise from the image.
  - The image is made b/w.
  - Tesseract recommends that scanned images have a 10 pt white border.
